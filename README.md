## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Livestream Service using Multicast for video broadcasting. The project includes two key components:

- Java Video Streaming Service: A video streaming service built using Java and Multicast to efficiently broadcast video streams to multiple clients within the same network.

- FastAPI User Service: A user management and view history tracking service built using FastAPI (Python). This service manages user authentication, livestream view history, and provides a REST API for interacting with the user data.

Both services are containerized using Docker and can be run together using Docker Compose. The Java Video Streaming Service broadcasts video streams using UDP Multicast, ensuring efficient delivery of video content to multiple clients within the same network. The FastAPI User Service handles user authentication, registration, and tracking user interactions with the streams.

The services can be extended for broader use cases such as adding WebRTC for video communication or integrating with gRPC for high-performance communication between microservices.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.

- **Python 3.9+** for FastAPI development (optional if using Docker).

- **Java 11+** for Spring Boot development (optional if using Docker).

## Installation and Running the Project
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fastapi-springboot-project.git
cd fastapi-springboot-project
```
2. Run both services with Docker Compose
- The project includes a docker-compose.yml file that helps you easily run both services.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Access the services
- FastAPI Backend: The FastAPI service will be accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can use endpoints like /users:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/users
```
- Spring Boot Service: The Spring Boot service will be accessible at http://localhost:8080. For example, you can use the /api/users endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/api/users
```
4. Stopping the services
- To stop the services, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## FastAPI Service Details
FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It is designed for high-performance applications and is extremely easy to use.

### API Endpoints
- GET /users: Returns a list of users.
### Running FastAPI without Docker
If you want to run the FastAPI service without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the fastapi-backend/ directory.
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
## Spring Boot Service Details
Spring Boot is a widely-used Java framework for building web services and microservices with robust configuration and high scalability.

### API Endpoints
- GET /api/users: Returns a list of users from Spring Boot.
### Running Spring Boot without Docker
If you want to run the Spring Boot service without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the springboot-service/ directory.
2. Build the project using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. Run the Spring Boot server:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## Docker Compose Configuration
In the docker-compose.yml, both services are connected in a single network to ensure they can communicate with each other.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  fastapi-backend:
    build: ./fastapi-backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    networks:
      - app-network

  springboot-service:
    build: ./springboot-service
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```
## Testing
FastAPI: You can run unit tests using pytest for FastAPI:
```bash
pytest
```
Spring Boot: You can run unit tests using JUnit in Spring Boot:
```bash
mvn test
```
## Extending the Project
- gRPC Integration: You can extend this project by adding gRPC communication between the FastAPI and Spring Boot services for faster inter-service communication.
- Database Support: Add database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL) to each service to store and manage persistent data.
- Authentication: Add JWT-based authentication or OAuth2 to secure the services.
