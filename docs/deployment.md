# Deployment Documentation: GitHub Classroom Automation Tool
This deployment guide will walk you through the steps necessary to deploy the GitHub Classroom Automation Tool. The tool is designed to automate tasks such as creating repositories, tracking progress, sending notifications, and grading assignments through GitHub API. You can deploy the project locally or on cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. A Dockerized deployment option is also available for containerized environments.

## 1. Prerequisites
Before deploying the tool, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT): To interact with the GitHub API.
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- SMTP credentials: For sending email notifications (optional if using GitHub Issues for notifications).
- GitHub Organization: To manage your classroom repositories.
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional): For Dockerized deployment.

## 2. Environment Setup
### 2.1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the GitHub Classroom Automation Tool repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-classroom-automation.git
cd github-classroom-automation
```
### 2.2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2.3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project to store sensitive information such as your GitHub token, email credentials, and any other configuration details.

```bash
touch .env
```
Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```
Make sure to replace the values with your actual credentials.

## 3. Deployment Options
### 3.1. Local Deployment
#### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Make sure Python is installed and your environment is configured correctly (as per step 2). Once you have set up the environment, you can run the application locally.

#### Step 2: Run the Application
Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python src/app.py
```
This will start the tool and allow it to automate GitHub Classroom tasks such as creating repositories, tracking progress, and sending notifications. Make sure that you have configured your .env file correctly to interact with GitHub's API and your email server.

### 3.2. Dockerized Deployment
If you prefer a containerized deployment, you can use Docker to run the tool in an isolated environment.

#### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose
If you don't have Docker installed, follow the installation guide for your OS from the [Docker Documentation]().

#### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
Here’s a sample Dockerfile for the GitHub Classroom Automation Tool:

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project files to the working directory
COPY . /app

# Install required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
ENV GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN
ENV EMAIL_SERVER=$EMAIL_SERVER
ENV EMAIL_PORT=$EMAIL_PORT
ENV EMAIL_USER=$EMAIL_USER
ENV EMAIL_PASS=$EMAIL_PASS

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "src/app.py"]
```
#### Step 3: Build the Docker Image
In the root directory of your project, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t github-classroom-automation .
```
#### Step 4: Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the container:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -d github-classroom-automation
```
This will start the tool inside a Docker container and run it with your environment variables.

## 4. GitHub Actions Configuration
If you are using GitHub Actions for auto-grading, you need to configure the workflow. Here’s a sample main.yml file for your .github/workflows directory:

```yaml
name: Auto Grading

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run unit tests
      run: pytest
```
This workflow will automatically run unit tests every time a student pushes code to the repository.

## 5. Security Considerations
- Environment Variables: Always store your environment variables securely. For local deployments, use the .env file. For cloud deployments, use the platform’s environment variable management tools (e.g., Heroku config or AWS Parameter Store).
- GitHub Token: Ensure that your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored securely and has the minimum necessary permissions.
- SMTP Credentials: Keep your email credentials secure and ensure that emails are sent using TLS or SSL.


This concludes the deployment guide for the GitHub Classroom Automation Tool. Follow the steps outlined to deploy the tool either locally, via Docker.
